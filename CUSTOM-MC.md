# Installing custom versions of Minecraft

### `Install .jar` feature (most mod loaders: Forge â‰¥ 1.6, Fabric, Quilt..., some custom clients)

1. Download the installer from their websites.
2. Open the launcher, tap `install .jar` and select the downloaded file.
3. Follow the instructions of the installer to install custom versions to the launcher.

### Through compressed game files (some custom clients, ...)

`Compressed game files` are game files stored in an archive format (zip, rar...)

Game files are saved in `.minecraft/versions`. To install, just unarchive the file, then move its contents to `.minecraft/versions`.
