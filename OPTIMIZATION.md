# Optimizing the game

There are lots of ways to optimize your Java Edition experience if it's being slow for you; or your device is just bad in general. From mods like OptiFine and Sodium to more complex stuff like JVM arguments, we'll cover all of them here.

## OptiFine
OptiFine, previously known as Optimine and OptiFog, is a popular Minecraft modification to improve frame rate, add support for high-definition textures, and decorative shaders.

### Getting (and installing) OptiFine
- Go to the official [OptiFine website](https://optifine.net).

## Sodium
Sodium is a Minecraft mod for Fabric/Quilt mod loader. It helps improving frame rate by utilizing features found in modern GPUs.
Currently Sodium is supported in PojavLauncher, through its `ANGLE` renderer.
